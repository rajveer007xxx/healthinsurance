## Update After Further Testing

### Pages Confirmed Working ✅

17. **Deleted Users** ✅ - Page loads correctly with "Loading..." state
18. **Payment Gateways** ✅ - Page displays "No payment gateways configured" message correctly

### Routing Analysis

The routing issue was a false alarm. The console error "No routes matched location '/admin/refund-list'" occurred because the browser was trying to access URLs with different patterns than what's configured in the routes.

**Correct Routes (as configured in App.tsx):**
- `/admin/employees` → Employee Management
- `/admin/connection-requests` → Connection Request  
- `/admin/expenses` → Expense List
- `/admin/refunds` → Refund List

All routes are correctly configured and match the sidebar navigation links in AdminLayout.tsx.
