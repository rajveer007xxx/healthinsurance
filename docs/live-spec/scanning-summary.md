- Live site has NO "Sl. No." column in Payment History (user originally requested this)
- Many pages show "Under Construction" - need to create placeholder implementations
- Consistent design: teal sidebar (#448996), accent (#00A0A0), borders (#336677)
- Common patterns: alphabet filters, pagination, multi-filter systems
- All tables use similar styling and action buttons

## Next Steps
Continue scanning remaining 16 pages to document exact structure before implementation.
